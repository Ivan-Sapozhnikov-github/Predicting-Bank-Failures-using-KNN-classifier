# Predicting-Bank-Failures-using-KNN-classifier
Used KNN classifier to predict whether or not a bank insured by the FDIC would fail. Evaluated the model using a heatmap.

This model was not effective as there were not enough failed banks, and the KNN classifier would exclusively predict that a bank did not fail.
This should serve more to show my ability to create and evaluate a KNN model. The model performance was not effective.
If I were to pursue evaluating this data-set more, I would first have to deal with this imbalance using under/over sampling
